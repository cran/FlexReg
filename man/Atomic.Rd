\item{\code{y}}{the number of cells with chromosomal abnormalities.}
\item{\code{n}}{the number of analyzed cells.  It is fixed to 100 for all the observations.}
\item{\code{dose}}{a quantitative measure of the radiation exposure level, expressed in rads.}
\item{\code{bomb}}{a factor, indicating which bomb the subject survived (H = Hiroshima, N = Nagasaki).}
